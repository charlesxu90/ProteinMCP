# Protein Design MCPs

Design protein sequences and structures using deep learning and physics-based methods.

| MCP | Runtime | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| [ProteinMPNN MCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/proteinmpnn_mcp) | python | ProteinMPNN for protein design (inverse folding) |
| [LigandMPNN MCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/ligandmpnn_mcp) | python | LigandMPNN for ligand-aware scaffold-based sequence generation |
| [RFdiffusion2 MCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/rfdiffusion2_mcp) | python | RFdiffusion2 for protein structure generation (backbone) |
| [Rosetta MCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/rosetta_mcp) | python | Rosetta molecular modeling and protein design suite |

## Install

```bash
pmcp install proteinmpnn_mcp
pmcp install ligandmpnn_mcp
pmcp install rfdiffusion2_mcp
